A few days a go,I have read a [article](http://www.163.com) about exploiting private api in iOS to record anything user typed without a un-jailborken device.

    1. User can easily change the order of all keys on the keyboard(by shuffle the key set linked list).
    2. User can simple recover the default key arrangement.
    3. Anything user typed will not be persistented.
